          <strong class="text-brand-red">Mission Statement</strong>
          <p>The Mission Statement of the Strength and Power Hall of Fame is to honor the leaders, legends, and
            heroes of strength sports, preserve the history of these sports, and promote the values consistent with
            drug-free, humble, and community engaged champions!</p>

        <div class="m-4 p-3">
          <strong class="text-brand-red">Values and Ethics</strong>
          <p class>The Selection Committee (SC) recognizes the accomplishments of strength and power athletes! As a
            matter of subsequence, it is the chief priority of the afore-mentioned to provide a place where those
            involved in our sports can connect with each other in a friendly and professional manner. The Selection
            Committee also believes that many can be inducted into this Hall. In other words, the SC does not feel
            that a large number of honorees will diminish or devalue the honor itself. However, it is agreed that
            there must be criteria for admittance. </p>

          <strong class="text-brand-red">Motivation</strong>
          <p>The Selection Committee recognizes that strength athletes are rarely given the credit they deserve.
            As small money sport athletes, powerlifters, olympic weightlifters, strongmen, strong-women,
            shot-putters, as well as others of the like, are rarely featured or covered in the media. We very
            well may be the most mis-perceived grouping of athletes in the world. In large part, it is do to
            both ignorance and an unwillingness by those in the media to explore our world. Recently, university
            studies have revealed what we have known to be true for decades. Strength athletes are among the
            most explosive, fastest, and well conditioned in the world. Furthermore, our value to major league
            sports like football, baseball, etc. is undeniable. Are there any top athletes today that don't use
            what we have been doing and preaching for decades? The benefits of strength and power training are
            obvious! Even still, we are rarely credited, and that is the main purpose of this Hall of Fame. It's
            about time that we pay tribute to, and honor, ourselves!</p>
